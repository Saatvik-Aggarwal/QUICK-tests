Usage Guide:

Copy bench.sh and bm_ind.slurm to the quick install directory
Run ./bench.sh (might have to chmod +x bench.sh) and pass in the input file directory (defaults to benchmarkinputs) as the first parameter.

Example: 

./bench.sh test_these_files

In this case, test_these_files is a folder containing a bunch of .in files.
